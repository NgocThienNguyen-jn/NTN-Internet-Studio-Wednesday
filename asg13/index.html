            <h2>About My Career Goals</h2>
            <p>
As someone who’s really into creative tech and design, I’m looking for jobs that let me mix creativity with hands-on technical work. My ideal job would be one where I can design and build things that people actually use, not just stuff that looks cool but has no purpose. I enjoy working on projects where frontend development and user experience come together, especially since I have experience with web design, interactive layouts, and thinking about how users move through a site. I like experimenting with different visual styles, layouts, and small interactions to see how they change the feeling of a project. I work best in environments that encourage learning, trying new tools, and giving feedback instead of expecting everything to be perfect right away. Overall, I want to be part of a team that cares about storytelling, design, and creating digital experiences that feel thoughtful and human.            </p>

                <p class="job-description">
This Netflix role feels like a great fit for me because it blends frontend development with data visualization, which is something I’m really interested in. Working on Netflix’s data experience platform would let me design and build interfaces that help people understand recommendations and data more clearly, especially at a huge scale. I like that this position also focuses on teamwork, mentoring, and explaining complex ideas in a way that makes sense, since I enjoy collaborating and learning from others. Netflix’s use of modern tools like React and GraphQL is exciting because it means I’d be constantly learning and improving my technical skills. The option to work remotely and the strong compensation range also make this role really appealing, especially at a company that continues to push boundaries in the entertainment industry.                </p>

The Riot Games design role really stands out to me because it focuses on creating meaningful player experiences, not just visuals that look good. Riot’s games and platforms are built around strong communities, and I like that their design process considers how players feel, interact, and connect with each other. This role would let me design experiences that go beyond screens and actually shape how people engage with games and esports culture. I’m especially drawn to the mix of research, interaction design, and high-fidelity prototyping, since that matches how I like to work from concept to final product. Riot’s emphasis on collaboration between designers, engineers, and storytellers feels like an environment where I could learn a lot and grow creatively. Overall, it feels like a place where design truly matters and where my interest in culture, interaction, and digital experiences would fit naturally.                </p>

Working as a frontend engineer at Apple would be a dream because of how much the company values design, detail, and user experience. Apple products are known for being simple on the surface but incredibly thoughtful underneath, which really matches how I approach my own work. This role would allow me to build clean, responsive interfaces while focusing on performance, accessibility, and consistency across platforms. I like that Apple encourages close collaboration between designers and engineers, since I enjoy working at that intersection instead of treating design and code as separate things. Being part of a team that builds products used by millions of people every day would push me to improve my technical skills and attention to detail. It also feels like an environment where craftsmanship, creativity, and technology are equally important, which is exactly what I’m looking for.                </p>
