	<h2>My Least Favorite Artist</h2>

	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beyonc%C3%A9">Beyoncé</a><br>
	Some listeners find Beyoncé’s music less appealing because her style can feel overproduced, with a heavy emphasis on spectacle rather than raw emotion. Others argue that her dominance in pop culture overshadows other talented artists, making her seem more like a brand than a relatable musician. This can lead certain audiences to feel disconnected from her work, even if they acknowledge her influence and success.
