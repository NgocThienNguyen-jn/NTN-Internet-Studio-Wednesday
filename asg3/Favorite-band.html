<h2>About Us</h2>
<img scr="asg3/img/w5lniofhxbe61.webp">
<p>
	K/DA is a virtual K-pop girl group created by Riot Games, the company behind League of Legends. The group debuted in 2018 with the song “POP/STARS”, performed by real artists (including members of (G)I-DLE, Madison Beer, and Jaira Burns) while the characters—Ahri, Akali, Evelynn, and Kai’Sa—appeared in animated music videos.<br>
They blend gaming, music, and pop culture, gaining huge popularity both inside and outside the gaming community. Their songs mix K-pop, pop, and hip-hop, and they’ve been used to promote League of Legends events like the World Championships. K/DA is seen as an example of how virtual idols can cross into mainstream entertainment.
