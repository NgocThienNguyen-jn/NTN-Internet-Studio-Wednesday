		Framing a project like a story makes it a lot easier to shape and refine your ideas because it helps you see the user as the main character in the experience. Instead of just thinking about features or functions, you are walking through their journey, what they want, what might get in the way, and how your design can guide them. Telling it like a story also makes complicated ideas feel simpler and easier to share with a team since everyone can picture what is happening step by step. It is a good way to spot gaps, cut out things that do not matter, and focus on the pieces that make the biggest impact. In the end it keeps the project from being just “usable” and pushes it toward being something people actually connect with and enjoy.

       Different ways to establish hierarchy in typography design include adjusting size, using different font weights, applying color or contrast, changing style (like italics or all caps), shifting alignment or placement, and varying spacing or proximity between text elements.

	<h2>Part 3</h2>
<h3>Creative Briefs</h3>
<p>
	<ul>
	<li>Problem: In today’s digital world, social events are often reduced to soundbites, hashtags, and fleeting headlines. This oversimplification strips away nuance and prevents people from engaging meaningfully with the cultural, emotional, and ethical dimensions of these events. There is a need for a digital space that goes beyond passive consumption and invites users to interact, reflect, and explore multiple perspectives.</li>
    <br><br>
	<li>Audiences: The primary audience for this project is college students, young professionals, and socially aware digital natives who are already accustomed to engaging with content online and are curious about deeper perspectives. They value creativity, interactivity, and media that makes them think critically rather than passively scrolling. A secondary audience includes educators, activists, and community leaders who may use the site as a resource to foster discussion and awareness in classrooms or community spaces. Together, these audiences share a desire for digital experiences that are both meaningful and relevant to their social and cultural lives.</li>    
	<br><br>
	<li>Competition: Competition comes from news outlets and blogs that cover similar social events, but these are often designed to prioritize speed and facts over engagement and dialogue. Social media platforms also compete for attention by providing immediacy but often lack depth, reducing conversations to reactive comments or short lived trends. Some interactive storytelling projects, like multimedia features by the New York Times or online exhibitions, also occupy a similar space. However, this project differentiates itself by merging design and narrative into a reflective, interactive journey, emphasizing dialogue and cultural awareness rather than pure information or spectacle.</li>
	<br><br>
	<li>Key Messages: The main idea of the project is that every social event has many layers and perspectives worth looking at. By mixing creative design with storytelling, the website shows that the web can be more than just a place to get information; it can also be a space for reflection and shared experiences. The project highlights how engaging with these stories on both an emotional and critical level helps people better understand their cultural and ethical impact, building empathy and awareness in ways that traditional reporting often misses.</li>
	<br><br>
	<li>Call to Action: The project invites users to take an active role in the experience. Visitors are encouraged to explore the interactive narrative, clicking through different perspectives to immerse themselves in the event. They are asked to reflect on what they see and consider how their own perspectives fit into the larger cultural and ethical conversation. Finally, users are encouraged to share the experience with friends, peers, or communities, extending the dialogue beyond the site itself and making the project part of a broader conversation.</li>
	<br><br>
	<li>How to Measure Success: Success will be measured by how effectively the site engages its audience and fosters reflection. Quantitative metrics such as time spent on the site, the number of interactions per user, and the depth of navigation will indicate engagement. Social media shares and reposts will help measure reach and visibility. Qualitative feedback, such as user reflections, peer critiques, or classroom discussions, will reveal whether the project successfully sparked critical and emotional responses. Ultimately, success will be defined by the project’s ability to go beyond informing users and instead leave them with a meaningful and lasting impression.</li>
