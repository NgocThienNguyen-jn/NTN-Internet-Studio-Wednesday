		Framing a project like a story makes it a lot easier to shape and refine your ideas because it helps you see the user as the main character in the experience. Instead of just thinking about features or functions, you are walking through their journey, what they want, what might get in the way, and how your design can guide them. Telling it like a story also makes complicated ideas feel simpler and easier to share with a team since everyone can picture what is happening step by step. It is a good way to spot gaps, cut out things that do not matter, and focus on the pieces that make the biggest impact. In the end it keeps the project from being just “usable” and pushes it toward being something people actually connect with and enjoy.

       Different ways to establish hierarchy in typography design include adjusting size, using different font weights, applying color or contrast, changing style (like italics or all caps), shifting alignment or placement, and varying spacing or proximity between text elements.
