        <h3>Classmate Discussion Summary</h3>
        <p>
            During my discussion with Michelle, we talked in detail about the meaning and tone behind each of my potential domain name options. I explained that I wanted something that feels personal yet creative, something that represents storytelling, reflection, and identity. Michelle mentioned that soulchapters.net and innerstory.blogs stood out the most because they clearly connect to my artistic and emotional themes. She said those names make the purpose of my website more understandable and intriguing, suggesting that it will be a space for expressive storytelling and self-discovery. She also noted how my past creative projects already show a strong sense of individuality and depth, so either of those names would fit naturally with my existing style and goals.

        <h3>Final Domain Choice</h3>
        <p>
            After thinking about it, I decided to go with <span class="highlight">soulchapters.net</span> as my final domain name. I like it because it feels poetic, meaningful, and versatile. It represents each stage of my creative and personal growth as a unique "chapter" of my soul. The name captures the kind of content I want to share, a mix of design, writing, and reflection that explores the deeper side of everyday experiences. It also gives me the freedom to expand my website over time, whether through visual projects, essays, or digital storytelling. To me, Soul Chapters is not just a title but a long-term creative identity that embodies who I am and what I want my work to express.
