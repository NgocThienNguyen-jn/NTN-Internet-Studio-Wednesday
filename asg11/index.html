                bring unmatched speed, agility, and tactics to the court. When we step onto that arena, 
                opponents know they're in for a storm of epic proportions. Meet our championship lineup!

                <p>
                    Neo brings bullet-time reflexes to our team, making him virtually untouchable on the court. 
                    His ability to perceive incoming dodgeballs in slow motion and dodge with superhuman agility 
                    makes him our defensive anchor. Plus, his experience bending the rules of reality means he 
                    sees angles and opportunities others simply can't comprehend.

                <p>
                    Diana Prince brings Amazonian strength and warrior precision to every throw. Her combat 
                    training and supernatural accuracy mean every ball she launches is a heat-seeking missile. 
                    With her lightning-fast reactions and unbreakable spirit, she's our offensive powerhouse 
                    who never backs down from a challenge.

                <p>
                    Peter Parker's spider-sense gives us an unfair advantage—he knows where every ball is going 
                    before it's even thrown! His wall-crawling abilities and acrobatic moves make him impossible 
                    to hit, and his web-slinging precision translates perfectly to pinpoint dodgeball accuracy. 
                    He's also great for team morale with his quick wit and friendly neighborhood spirit.

                <h2>Sherlock Holmes</h2>

                <p>
                    Holmes brings the strategic mastermind element to The Thunder Bolts. His deductive reasoning 
                    allows him to predict opponent patterns and weak points within seconds of the match starting. 
                    While others rely on physical prowess, Sherlock outthinks the competition, positioning our 
                    team perfectly and exploiting every tactical opening with calculated precision.

                <p>
                    Barry Allen is the ultimate wild card on our roster. With super-speed that breaks the laws 
                    of physics, he can catch multiple balls simultaneously, make impossible saves, and throw 
                    dodgeballs that appear to teleport across the court. Having a speedster means we essentially 
                    have five players doing the work of twenty. Game, set, and match—in under a second!
