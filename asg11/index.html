            <h1>PokéWrath - The Dodgeball Team</h1>
            <p class="intro">
            Meet the PokéWrath, a dodgeball team made up of my favorite Ghost type Pokémon. We’re all about mixing fun, strategy, and a little chaos on the court. Led by Gengar, our trickster captain, this team doesn’t just play to win. We play to haunt the competition.
            Each member brings something different: Mimikyu with its sneaky surprises, Chandelure with perfect aim, Mismagius pulling off mind-bending plays, and Froslass gliding across the court like an icy breeze. Together, they’ve got the speed, style, and spirit to make every match unforgettable.
            The PokéWrath aren’t just a team, we’re a vibe. Creepy? Maybe a little. But cool, clever, and unshakably united.

                    Gengar is the one running the show, and honestly, he makes it fun. He has this wild mix of energy and mischief that keeps everyone guessing. One second he’s laughing, the next he’s curving a dodgeball straight past you like it’s magic. He doesn’t just play dodgeball, he plays mind games. That grin of his means trouble. But somehow, he always pulls the team together when things get serious.

                <h2>Mimikyu</h2>

                <p>
                    Mimikyu is the quiet one, but it’s full of surprises. You’ll barely notice it at first, then suddenly it’s catching a ball out of nowhere and turning the whole game around. It’s sneaky in the best way, always hiding in plain sight, waiting for the perfect chance to strike. Mimikyu doesn’t say much, but when it acts, it changes everything.

                <h2>Chandelure</h2>

                <p>
                   Chandelure is pure focus. It plays the game like it’s painting, every throw smooth, every move sharp. You can almost feel the heat when it launches a ball across the court. It doesn’t rush or panic, it just watches, waits, and strikes with perfect aim. If the PokéPhantoms ever need a clean hit, Chandelure is the one to make it happen.

                <h2>Mismagius</h2>

                <p>
                    Mismagius is the team’s strategist, always thinking three steps ahead. It loves pulling off plays that leave everyone confused, like fake passes or sudden swaps that make no sense until they work. It has this mysterious vibe, calm but confident, like it’s orchestrating a whole performance instead of just playing a game. When Mismagius takes control, the match feels more like magic.

                <h2>Froslass</h2>

                <p>
                    Froslass is all about grace under pressure. It moves across the court like it’s gliding on ice, smooth, fast, and completely unfazed. Even when things get chaotic, Froslass keeps its cool. It knows exactly when to dodge, when to strike, and when to just chill. The others bring the fire, but Froslass brings the balance that keeps the team together.
