                    <h2>Zeus</h2>
                    <p>The greatest of all Greek heroes, Heracles embodies strength, courage, and redemption. Son of Zeus and the mortal Alcmene, he completed the legendary Twelve Labors that no other mortal could accomplish—from slaying the Nemean Lion to capturing Cerberus from the Underworld itself. I would be honored to host Heracles at my table to hear firsthand accounts of his incredible adventures and the wisdom he gained through suffering and perseverance. Beyond his mighty deeds, Heracles represents the struggle of the human condition: a hero who made terrible mistakes yet found redemption through his labors. His stories of battling monsters, confronting gods, and ultimately achieving immortality would make for an evening of unparalleled excitement. Plus, his legendary appetite would ensure none of our feast goes to waste!</p>

                    <h2>Poseidon</h2>
                    <p>The goddess of wisdom, warfare, and strategic thinking, Athena would bring divine insight and brilliant conversation to our symposium. Born fully armored from Zeus's head, she represents the perfect balance of intellect and strength, favoring heroes who use cunning alongside courage. I would relish the opportunity to discuss strategy, philosophy, and the nature of justice with the patron goddess of Athens herself. Athena guided heroes like Odysseus and Perseus, teaching them that wisdom often triumphs where brute force fails. Her perspectives on leadership, the arts of civilization, and the responsibilities of power would provide profound insights. As the inventor of the olive tree and patron of craftsmen, she appreciates both the simple pleasures of mortal life and the grand designs of fate. Her presence would elevate our gathering from a mere feast to a true symposium of ideas.</p>

                    <h2>Hades</h2>
                    <p>The cunning hero of Troy and protagonist of Homer's Odyssey, Odysseus would be the consummate storyteller at our feast. Known for his clever wit, eloquent speech, and resourcefulness, the king of Ithaca survived ten years of war and ten more years of perilous journey home. I would be captivated to hear his tales of the Cyclops, the Sirens, Circe's island, and his descent into the Underworld—stories that blend adventure with profound reflections on loyalty, home, and identity. Odysseus represents the thinking warrior, the hero who survives not just through strength but through intelligence, adaptability, and sheer determination. His experiences with gods, monsters, and the best and worst of humanity would provide endless fascinating conversation. Moreover, his long absence from home and eventual reunion with Penelope speaks to themes of endurance, love, and the meaning of homecoming that resonate across all ages.</p>
