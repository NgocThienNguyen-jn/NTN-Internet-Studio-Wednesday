                <h3>Biography</h3>
                <p>
                   Hades, ruler of the Underworld, is one of the eldest sons of Cronus and Rhea and brother to Zeus and Poseidon. Though often misunderstood, Hades governs not death itself but the order and balance of the afterlife. He keeps the cycle of life turning, ensuring that justice and consequence are not forgotten in the divine world.
                </p>
                
                <h3>Why Hades Should Lead</h3>
                <p>
                     Olympus needs stability and fairness qualities long ignored under Zeusâ€™s chaotic leadership. Hades brings logic, patience, and equality to the divine realm. He values every soul, godly or mortal, and believes in rewarding virtue and discipline over vanity and favoritism. His calm and strategic nature make him an ideal ruler to bring harmony to both Olympus and the Underworld.

     Persephone embodies renewal, balance, and empathy. As co-ruler of the Underworld and goddess of spring, she bridges life and death, warmth and cold, joy and sorrow. Her compassion complements Hadesâ€™s discipline, forming a leadership duo that symbolizes transformation; one who brings growth even in the darkest soil.
