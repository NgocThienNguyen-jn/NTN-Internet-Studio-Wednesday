        <h1>Wireframing</h1>
        

        <h2>Question 1: Advantages and Disadvantages of Sketching</h2>
        <p>Sketching wireframes is a fast and flexible way to brainstorm design ideas. It allows designers to quickly explore layouts, content placement, and structure without getting distracted by fonts, colors, or other visual details. Because it's simple and hands-on, sketching encourages creativity and makes it easy to move between big concepts and small details on the same page. However, sketching also has some clear limitations compared to wireframing software. It can't show interactivity or animations, and it's difficult to edit or reuse sketches once they're drawn. Collaboration and version control are also limited since sketches are usually physical and not shared in real time. In addition, hand-drawn wireframes may look inconsistent or unpolished, especially for those without design experience. Overall, sketching is great for quick idea generation, but digital wireframing tools are better for refining, sharing, and testing designs.</p>

        <h2>Question 2: Best Wireframing Style for My Project</h2>
        <p>For my project, a <span class="accent">digital wireframing software</span> style would work best because it allows me to design with more structure, precision, and interactivity. Since my website includes multiple connected pages and interactive elements, using a tool like Figma or UXPin helps me visualize how users will navigate between sections and experience the content flow. Unlike paper sketches, digital wireframing lets me easily edit, duplicate, and adjust elements while maintaining consistency across pages. It also supports collaboration, so I can share my progress and receive feedback instantly. Most importantly, software wireframing provides features like grids, templates, and clickable prototypes, which make the final design feel closer to the actual website. This approach saves time, improves clarity, and helps ensure that the final product aligns with my creative vision.</p>

            <h2>My Website Wireframes</h2>
            <p>Below are the wireframes for my website's homepage and three subpages. These wireframes illustrate the layout, navigation structure, and key content elements.</p>
