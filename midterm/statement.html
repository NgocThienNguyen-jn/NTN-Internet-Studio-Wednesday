        <h2>Design Philosophy</h2>
        <p>The Vietnam Journey website was designed with a singular purpose: to evoke the emotional experience of traveling to Vietnam before visitors ever book their trip. Every design choice—from typography to color palette to imagery—was intentionally crafted to communicate luxury, authenticity, cultural richness, and wanderlust. The design balances sophistication with accessibility, recognizing that while travelers seek premium experiences, they also want genuine, meaningful connections with Vietnam's people and places. The visual language throughout the site speaks to both the romantic allure of Southeast Asian travel and the practical needs of journey planning, creating a cohesive experience that inspires booking while providing essential information.</p>

        <h2>Typography & Visual Hierarchy</h2>
        <p>Typography serves as the primary vehicle for establishing the website's personality and guiding users through content. The selection of Playfair Display for all primary headings communicates elegance, luxury, and timelessness—qualities that define premium travel experiences. Playfair Display is a high-contrast serif typeface with generous letterforms that evoke the glamour of 1920s Art Deco design, subtly referencing Vietnam's French colonial heritage. This typeface choice dignifies the content and creates a sense of aspiration, suggesting that a trip to Vietnam is not merely a vacation but a transformative journey to be treasured. The serif style also bridges historical and contemporary aesthetics, honoring Vietnam's rich past while presenting a modern travel platform. The large, confident sizing of primary headings (up to 5rem on the hero section) immediately captures attention and establishes visual hierarchy, signaling importance and creating dramatic focal points that guide the eye through the page.</p>

        <p>For body text, Lato was selected for its exceptional readability, modern friendliness, and versatility. Lato is a humanist sans-serif that carries warmth and approachability, qualities essential for travel content that must inform while inspiring. The open letterforms and generous spacing of Lato ensure that lengthy descriptive paragraphs remain engaging rather than daunting, crucial for users seeking detailed information about activities and dining. The secondary use of Montserrat for navigation, buttons, and structural labels creates an additional layer of visual organization. Montserrat's geometric precision and bold weights ensure that calls-to-action are unmissable, literally stepping forward on the page through weight and stature. This three-font system creates clear hierarchy without visual chaos: Playfair Display establishes gravitas and vision, Lato provides friendly information, and Montserrat commands action. The sizing progression—large headings that decrease in scale through subheadings to body text—creates a natural reading rhythm that guides users effortlessly through content. This hierarchy ensures that even users skimming the page encounter the most important information first.</p>

        <p>Text placement and size decisions reinforce the site's user-centered approach. Hero section text is centered and given substantial breathing room, respecting the visual weight of the dramatic background image while ensuring readability. In multi-section pages like Activities and Dining, content is presented in alternating left-right layouts, preventing monotony while maintaining scannability. Body text is sized at 1.05-1.1rem with 1.6-1.9 line-height, exceeding web accessibility standards and accommodating users with varying visual capabilities. Justified text alignment on longer paragraphs creates sophistication while maintaining even margins, though left alignment is used in forms and lists for maximum clarity and accessibility. The strategic use of short lines (90-character max for body text) prevents eye strain and maintains engagement, particularly important for content-heavy pages describing activities and restaurants.</p>

        <h2>Color Palette & Visual Emotion</h2>
        <p>The color palette was developed to evoke specific emotional responses while honoring Vietnamese cultural identity. Primary Gold (#D4AF37) serves as the hero accent color, symbolizing luxury, premium experiences, and the treasures of Southeast Asian travel. Gold carries historical weight—evoking both traditional Vietnamese silk production and contemporary luxury travel marketing—while remaining universally recognized as a signal of quality and value. This particular shade of gold is warm rather than sterile, suggesting handcrafted rather than industrial luxury. Deep Forest Green (#1A472A) was selected as the primary structural color, representing Vietnam's mountainous landscape, lush rice paddies, jade mountains, and the natural abundance that defines the country's geography. This rich, saturated green is sophisticated and cal
