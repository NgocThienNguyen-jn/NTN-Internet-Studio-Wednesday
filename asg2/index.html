     1. Structured content and semantic HTML are closely related but not the same. Structured content is all about how information is planned and broken into smaller, meaningful chunks that connect to each other, like steps in a recipe or options to pay a ticket. Semantic HTML, on the other hand, is the coding tool that gives those chunks meaning on a webpage. Instead of just styling how text looks, it uses tags to tell both humans and machines what role that piece of content plays.<br><br>
	 2. These two work best when used together. Structured content provides the organized blueprint of information, and semantic HTML expresses that blueprint in a way that machines can read. For example, when payment options are marked up under a main heading, it signals to search engines or voice assistants that those items belong to one category, making the content clear both visually and logically.<br><br>
	 3. Having both structured content and semantic HTML is important because people don’t just read web pages anymore; they ask voice assistants, search on Google, and rely on AI to find answers. Without structure and meaning, machines can misinterpret content or skip it altogether, like in the Boston example. With both in place, though, content becomes flexible and trustworthy, able to show up correctly whether on a website, in a search snippet, or spoken out loud by a smart device.

	1. I think the method that would work best for me is reassigning duty to the inner critic, basically asking it to step aside during the creative part and only come back later when it is actually useful, like when I am editing or polishing ideas. I relate to this a lot because I usually get stuck at the start of projects, second guessing every thought before it even has a chance to grow. If I could send that voice on a break while I brainstorm, I would feel more free to just put ideas down without worrying about whether they are good or not. Then, once I have something to work with, I can let the critic return to help shape and improve it. This way, I am not trying to silence my inner critic completely but instead giving it the right role at the right time, which I think would help me stay creative while still making sure the final work is solid.<br><br>
	2. In David McRaney’s article, hyperbolic discounting is basically our habit of going for the smaller reward right now instead of waiting for the bigger payoff later. One way he says you can fight this is through precommitment, basically tricking your future self into staying on track. For me, the deadline strategy would work best, because I know if I leave everything open ended, I’ll keep pushing it off. Smaller deadlines along the way help me actually finish things instead of cramming at the last minute.<br><br>
	3. When I put a site online, I’m using real network making power. I choose what to link, which voices to boost, what tags and titles help people find it, and whether it’s accessible with clean HTML and good alt text. Even small choices like my repo license, a readme, or avoiding dark patterns shape how others move through my page and who feels included. But my power has limits. Web standards and browsers decide what’s possible, hosting and DNS control access, and search engines tend to push big, popular sites first. Biases can show up in those systems too. So my plan is simple: use the power I do have with clear, accessible code, intentional links (especially to underrepresented work), honest UX, and open licensing to make my little corner of the web more inclusive, while staying aware that algorithms and platforms still affect who actually sees it.
